Nonlinear Multipoint Boundary Value Problem Solver in C++ based on the below:
[1] Ojika, T., and Y. Kasue. "Initial-value adjusting method for the solution of nonlinear multipoint boundary-value problems."
Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications 69.2 (1979): 359-371.
[2] Welsh, Wayne, and Takeo Ojika. "Multipoint boundary value problems with discontinuities I. Algorithms and applications."
Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics 6.2 (1980): 133-143.
This was in response to a need for a suitable C++ alternative to bvp4c in Mathworks MATLAB.
